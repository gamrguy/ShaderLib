A library intended to ease the creation of shaders.

This is a dependency mod; it does nothing by itself.
Other mods may require this mod to be enabled.

Latest Patch (1.0.1):
- Fixed modded dyes not working on modded accessories (or specific vanilla ones)
- Held item dyes now apply to held items
- Flame shader hooks actually work now
